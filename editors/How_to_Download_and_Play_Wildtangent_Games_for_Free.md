I asked for a refund but they insist the game work and keep telling me to restart my computer, reinstall the game, and now to send them all this technical info. I don't want the game anymore. I'd just like my money back. I've cancelled my subscription to them because their customer service is absolutely worthless and the Company sells faulty games." - Chase R

> "My wife has used this platform for many years and you used to be able to load money on your account and pay a small fee to play each game. My wife has gone a long time with just the free 30 minute sessions so I figured I'd load some money on it like I used to only to find that the only option was to subscribe so I did. Once I subscribed I was surprised to find that all it did was give you discounted prices for the rentals and purchases this is the biggest scam Ive ever seen" - korean pittbull

> "I have played Wildtangent games every night for many years. It has undergone aesthetic changes a few times and all were disappointing honestly, but at least the games worked!
